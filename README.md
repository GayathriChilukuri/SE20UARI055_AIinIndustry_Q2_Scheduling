Average waiting time of scheduling algorithms(in order of fcfs,sjf,ps and rr respectively):[31.25, 23.75, 52.5, 45.5]

Average turn around time of scheduling algorithms(in order of fcfs,sjf,ps and rr respectively): [57.5, 50.0, 78.75, 71.75]

--> Hence we can see that in this case, the Shortest job first is the most efficient scheduling algorithm.
--> And the order in which the patients need to be attended to is: A,D,B,C
